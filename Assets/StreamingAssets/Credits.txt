SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

Soundsnap License- Full legal document
This license is the basis under which all Works that appear in the SoundSnap website are distributed and used. The SoundSnap License is governed by the Terms of Service Agreement displayed on the website.

Any use of the Work other than as authorized under this License or Copyright Law is prohibited.

The Licensor grants the Licensee ("You") a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to exercise the rights that are contained herein in consideration of your acceptance of these license terms and conditions and our Terms and Conditions.

We encourage you to attribute the creators of the Works that you use in your projects or the SoundSnap community where possible, but this remains entirely up to your discretion.

1. Definitions
a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as an audio compilation or anthology, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in and of themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work, such as a remix, musical arrangement, dramatization, sound recording, art reproduction, synchronization with moving image, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

c. "Licensor" means SoundSnap.

d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License (including the sounds, music loops, and one-shots).

f. "You" or ÅgyourÅf means the end user (either an individual or entity) exercising rights under this License.

2. Fair Use Rights.
Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under Copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, revocable, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

a. To remix or transform the sounds into a Derivative Work;

b. To copy and transmit the sounds and available content in various mediums or formats as long as the sounds and available content are included in another work or with other materials;

c. To use the sounds in any music, film, video game, website or similar medium whether commercial in nature, or not.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted to You under this License by Licensor, are hereby reserved by Licensor.
Please note the following license restrictions regarding our content. You may not:

i. Resell, rent, sublicense, transmit, and/or distribute or re-distribute the sounds 'as they are' in any context, this includes but is not exclusive to re-selling the sounds on CDs, torrents, or any other online distribution.

ii. Use any sound, music loop, or one-shots to create expansion packs to distribute them through any mobile applications, plugins, or similar products. This includes, but is not limited to putting our sounds and available content on any CD(s), websites, and/or digital platforms of any kind (either for a fee or for free).

iii. Use any sound, music loop, or one-shots for any trademark uses. This includes attempting to or actually registering any sound, music loop, or one-shots as a trademark for a business. (Uses in film alone as a fictional trademark, or ringtone, are permitted.)

iv. Use music loops or one-shots uploaded by ÅgSoundsnap BeatsÅh (licensed by Loop Masters) in isolation, in unaltered form (as they are), due to licensing restrictions. For instance, you cannot use an unaltered music loop as a soundtrack for a film or video game. Using them as part of a music track, musical score, or creative composition within a film is permitted.

4. Restrictions
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may copy, use, alter or change, make derivative works from, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and/or distribute any Work only under the terms of this License. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License.

In no circumstances whatsoever, may you copy all or a significant part of the Works in the SoundSnap website with the purpose of redistributing them.

You may not use music loops (sounds labeled in the ÅgSoundsnap Beats licensed by Music Loops category) uploaded by ÅeLoop Masters' in isolation and unmodified in any medium. All music loops must be used in the context of an original music composition.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing, Licensor offers the Work as is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence of absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.

6. Limitation on Liability
Except to the extent required by applicable Law, in no event will the Licensor be liable to you on any legal theory for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of this License or the use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

This License, which is part of and is governed by, the Terms of Service Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified therein. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may only be modified by the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
